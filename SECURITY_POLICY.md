# Security Policy

We take security as seriously as Chuck Norris takes his coffee—strong and hot!

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you find a vulnerability, reach out with urgency as if requesting a roundhouse kick from Chuck Norris.

1. Send an email to security@example.com, because even Chuck Norris respects proper channels.
2. Clearly describe the vulnerability, as Chuck Norris would describe his sense of justice.

**"Chuck Norris doesn’t do malware; malware does Chuck Norris."**
